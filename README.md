# SPELL CHECKER 
This project utilizes the Trie data structure to check the spelling of input text and mark incorrect spellings. Users can upload a PDF file containing all the words that need to be considered correct by the system.


## Features
 - Spelling Check: Quickly identify and mark incorrect spellings in the input text.
 - Custom Dictionary: Users can upload a PDF file containing a list of correct words to be used as a dictionary for spell checking.
 - Efficient: Trie data structure ensures fast and efficient spell checking, even for large texts.

## Usage
 1. Upload Dictionary: Before using the spell checker, upload a PDF file containing all the words that should be considered correct by the system.
 2. Input Text: Enter the text to be spell-checked.
 3. Spell Checking: The system will analyze the input text and mark incorrect spellings, if any.
 4. View Results: Review the spell-checked text with highlighted incorrect spellings.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies(Run the following commands in the terminal):
 - git clone https://github.com/MuKuLJain07/Spell-Checker-using-Django.git
 - cd Spell-Checker-using-Django
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Getting Started
### Run the application:
 - python manage.py runserver
 - Open the application in your web browser.
 - Provide the link of dictionary PDF file and input text.
 - Initiate the spell check process.

## Usage
A crucial application of this project arises when users are required to adhere strictly to a predetermined set of dictionary keywords. By enforcing this restriction, the system ensures precision and consistency in communication within specialized domains. Users upload a custom dictionary containing the approved keywords, and the system validates input text against this dictionary, flagging any deviations. This functionality is particularly valuable in fields where precise terminology is paramount, such as medical documentation or technical writing.
